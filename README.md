# FizzBuzz

This repository contains an implementation of the classic FizzBuzz algorithm in Java. FizzBuzz is a popular programming exercise often used to assess logical thinking and proficiency with loops and conditionals.

## How to Run

To run this project, first, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajjadsaroo/FizzBuzz.git
```

Then, navigate to the `src` folder where the main class is located:

```bash
cd FizzBuzz/src
```

Compile and run the Java program:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Program Logic

The program prints numbers from 1 to 100 and follows these rules:

- If a number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
- If a number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.
